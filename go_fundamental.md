## 🧠 What is Go?

Go (also called Golang) is an **open-source programming language** developed by Google. It was designed with the following goals:

- Simplicity and readability (like Python)
- Performance close to C/C++
- Powerful concurrency support (via goroutines)
- Fast compile times and static typing

## ⚙️ Is Go Compiled or Interpreted?

Go is a **compiled language**. This means:

- Your `.go` code is **translated into machine code** by the Go compiler (`go build`)
- The output is a **standalone binary** (`.exe` on Windows, no extension on Unix systems)
- No runtime dependency is needed to execute the binary — just run it!

|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| Type System        | Static, strong             | Dynamic                   | Static, strong             | Static, strong            |
| Compilation        | Compiled to binary         | Interpreted               | Compiled to bytecode (JVM) | Compiled to binary        |

## 🚀 How Go Code is Compiled

1. You write Go code in `.go` files.

2. Use:
   ```bash
   go build
   # or
   go run

3. The Go compiler:
    - Compiles your code to native machine code
    - Embeds the Go runtime
    - Produces a single, standalone binary

4. This binary can run independently on your OS — no Go installation needed.

## 🔁 What is the Go Runtime?

Every Go executable includes the **Go runtime** — a lightweight, built-in library compiled into the binary. It provides core functionality required for Go programs to run efficiently.

## ✅ Key Components of the Go Runtime

| **Component**         | **Description**                                               |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Goroutine scheduler** | Manages thousands of concurrent goroutines (lightweight threads) |
| **Garbage collector**   | Reclaims memory automatically                                 |
| **Stack management**    | Dynamically grows/shrinks stacks per goroutine               |
| **Thread manager**      | Maps goroutines to OS threads efficiently                    |
| **Timers/event loops**  | Manages `time.Sleep()`, tickers, and async timers            |
| **Initialization logic** | Prepares the environment and calls your `main()` function     |

## ⚡ Why Go is Great for Server-Side Applications

Go is a top choice for building high-performance server-side software. Here’s why:

- 🧵 **Goroutines**: Efficiently handle thousands of concurrent connections  
- 🚦 **Channels and select**: Safe and structured concurrency  
- 🔧 **Minimal memory overhead**: Smaller memory footprint than Java/Python  
- 🌐 **Built-in HTTP server**: Easily build REST APIs and microservices  
- 📦 **Single-binary deployment**: No virtual environment or external runtime  
- 📈 **Scales horizontally**: Ideal for cloud-native architectures
